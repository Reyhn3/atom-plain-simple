[HEADING 1]
	Text is vertically separated by headings placed inside [] square brackets.
	This is a just a simple text paragraph.


	[Leading indents don't matter]
		That was a subheading.

		List:
			*	List item 1
			2)	Numbered
			ยง	Paragraph
			ยง4	Paragraph 1
			ยง 5	Paragraph 2


	[HEADING @ $3]
		Headings work with _any_ characters!
		Emphasizing *is* great **for real**, although_ not _fantastic! (:

		[HEADING 4] with something after it is not really a heading
			This [should] be "optional" or not 'mandatory'.


	[Heading with 2015-12-24 13:34]
		Headings take precedence over any other format.
		URLs http://atom.io/, and paths C:\Windows\, are colored for easier identification.
		The same goes for 192.168.0.1 IP-adresses.
		This, 2015-12-24, has a date and 12:24:35.777 a timestamp.


	[Number Highlighting]
		Numbers -3.14157,  0xFF and digits 7 are highlighted because they usually carry significance.
		And here's a formula 2 * (3 + 1) / 4 = ? to prove it!
